                <p>The priest incensation rite is a sacred act during the liturgy in which incense is used to honor and 
                    purify the priest before the reading of the Gospel. It symbolizes reverence, the sanctity of the moment, 
                    and the prayers of the faithful rising to heaven. As part of this ritual, we put incense powder on the 
                    priest for the Gospel, signifying his spiritual preparation to proclaim the holy Word.</p>

                <p>I am the Admission DTS Assistant of Mr. Viador John Viajar from the Human Formation Department (HFD). 
                    My duties include facilitating interviews and entrance exams, assisting with the S.T.O.P. training, 
                    and disciplining students who do not follow the rules of CITE. I also help in organizing documents and 
                    coordinating with other departments to ensure a smooth admission process. Through these responsibilities, 
                    I've developed better communication, time management, and leadership skills. Being part of the department 
                    has taught me the importance of discipline and professionalism in a work environment.</p>

            <p>Although I have not yet had the opportunity to gain formal job experience, I am highly motivated and

                hands-on experience that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally in the future. 
                I believe that a strong willingness to learn and adapt is just as important as prior experience, 
                especially in dynamic and fast-paced environments. Given the chance, I am confident that I can 
                quickly become a valuable contributor through dedication, hard work, and a genuine passion for 
                continuous improvement.</p>
